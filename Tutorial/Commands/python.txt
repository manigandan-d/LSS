Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.


Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.

				Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.


Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.

	Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
			 The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.
